I've always had a specific place in my heart for arena style pick-up-and-play pvp games, that don't sacrifice high skill expression. Games like Knockout City, Friends vs Friends, and of course Super Smash really resonate with me!

I wanted to make a game that fit that vision, the kind of game that you can open when you're bored with your friends and you don't know what to play, but you'll know you'll have a great time.

One day, while watching gameplay of a minecraft content creator (fruitberries) creatively place blocks on the edges of the map to escape his opponent, I realized just how expressive Minecraft's movement can be. Placing blocks affords you endless movement possibility, by allowing you to bend your environment to your will, in a way that's not that different to Fortnite's build mode.

That was the point I decided on building a minecraft minigame.

## the idea

There were a couple design goals that I had in mind when creating this game.

- The game should highlight that part of the game and let players access a near infinite level of skill expression through creative block placement.
- At the same time, anyone regardless of experience should be able to pick up the game and find it instantly enjoyable and fun.
- The fundamental mechanics of the game should have lots of game mode flexibility, it should be easy to support free-for-all, 1v1s, team battles, and asymmetric modes.

  No matter who you're hanging out with, there should always be a fitting gamemode to play together.

From these design goals, creating the concept of the game took some time, but I landed on a core concept where players spawns on a floating platform, and their goal is to knock other players off to score points. I felt the concept was just simple enough for anyone to intuitive grasp the objective. It also had a lot of flexibility what game modes can be set. You can easily turn a 6-person free-for-all into 2 teams of 3, or 3 teams of 2.

To accentuate the skill expression of block placement, I made each player have infinite blocks in their offhand, and I also ensured that the map provided opportunities for such expression through the deliberate placement of platform skips and wall-climbable pillars (both of which use blocks).

## introducing items

When introducing items, I wanted their role to be to encourage the right kinds of play, and introduce a healthy amount chaos and partylike atmosphere to the game, all without taking away from the skill of block placement. Here are the direct design challenges that I laid out to solve.

1. #### Encourage more emergent vertical play

   Without items, i predicted it would be common to build high without engaging, and the game would evolve and seperate into 2 layers, one at ground level and one at build height.

   With items, I hoped to make it easier to approach people at higher elevations, or reach higher elevations yourself.

2. #### Increase accessibility through fair rubber-banding.

   I took inspiration from Mario Kart with this one! _Accessibility is important and does not need to come at the sacrifice of player expression_. So I decided on a system where the further behind the player is, the more powerful items they recieve.

   I wanted items to assist players with less direct mechanical skill to be able to find success through highly strategic use of items, all while still providing enough counterplay for.

## balance case study #1: snowballs

one of the problems was that snowballs were too easy to spam if you were winning
because last place doesn't have ranged options
but i can't just reduce the quantity because that would also make it harder for people who arent exactly winning to succeed
so my solution

- split snowballs into 2 distinct items, 4 count and 8 count ones.
- make the 4 count ones for 1st place
- this allowed me to give snowballs to last place without feeling like they are getting a throwaway item because they are getting 8 snowballs
- also add trident, smoke bomb, molotov, obliterator
