# ideation

One day, while watching gameplay of a minecraft content creator (fruitberries) creatively place blocks on the edges of the map to escape his opponent, **I realized just how expressive Minecraft's movement can be**.

Placing blocks provides you with infinite possibilities for movement, allowing you to bend your environment to your will. In fact, it's not that different to Fortnite's build mode.

    </>
  }
/>

This is when I decided on making a minecraft minigame, one that lets gameplay like this shine.
However, I didn't want to follow the same footsteps that Fortnite had with build mode, where the skill floor grew to increasingly unreachable heights.

> I wanted a game that you know you'll enjoy when you're bored with your friends and you don't know what to play.

## landing on a core concept for the game

There were a couple design goals that I had in mind when creating the concept for the game.

1. The game should **highlight creative block placement** and allow players to access a near-infinite level of skill expression.
2. At the same time, anyone regardless of experience should be able to **pick up the game and find it instantly enjoyable** and fun.
3. The fundamental mechanics of the game should have lots of **game mode flexibility**, it should be easy to support ffa's, 1v1s, teams, and asymmetric modes. No matter who you're hanging out with, there should always be a fitting gamemode to play together.

> You spawn on a floating platform, and your goal is to knock other players off to score points. Items randomly spawn for all players, with more powerful items the further you are behind.
>
> The catch? **Each player has an infinite number of blocks in their offhand!**

This concept was just simple enough for anyone to intuitive grasp the objective, so it was easy to pick up. It also had a lot of flexibility what game modes can be set! You can easily turn a 6-person free-for-all into 2 teams of 3, or 3 teams of 2.

# iteration

## design # introducing items

While the main role of items is to provide accesibility, they have a lot of utility as a tool that I can use to **add a healthy amount of chaotic, party-like energy to the game's atmosphere**.

Here were the exact design challenges that I laid out to solve.

1. ### increase accessibility through fair rubber-banding

   > **Accessibility is important and does not need to come at the sacrifice of player expression.**

   I wanted items to assist players with less direct mechanical skill to still be able to make an impact through the strategic use of items.

   ![The further you are behind, the more powerful items you recieve!](/block-sumo_13.webm)

   **`Here's How:`** Inspired by Mario Kart, item rubber-banding keeps the game an enjoyable experience for players far behind. There's always a sense of agency from utilizing your items items strategically to make an impact on the game.

2. ### ensure item counterplay is always possible for those at the top

   Although I wanted the game to be easy to pick up and play with friends, I didn't want to take away from the skill expression of block placement.

   Even the most powerful items should have enough counterplay for players at the top to use their better mechanics to outplay them.

   ![No matter what gets thrown your way, there's always room to clutch](/block-sumo_16.webm)

   **`Here's How:`** First place still has access to _(less powerful)_ defensive items. So a lot of fun comes from using better mechanics, while **being resourceful with the defensive items you do have** to find the right counterplay to any situation.

3. ### encourage more emergent vertical play

   I wanted vertical movement as a staple of the game, where traversing up and down feels seamless and fluid. The game should play in a 3-dimensional space, not a 2-dimensional plane.

   Items should make it easier to traverse up and down, approach people at higher elevations, and bridge that vertical gap.

   ![Vertical mobility keeps movement feeling dynamic and expressive](/block-sumo_11.webm)

   **`Here's How:`** I was able to fulfill that 3d combat space fantasy by introducing a plethora of different quick-cast mobility items, including one that automatically builds a bridge.

4. ### influence the game's atmosphere

   Items should make the game feel more party-like in a controllable way that feels both strategic and chaotic in equal proportions.

   ![An early draft of item spawn rates depending on points behind](/block-sumo_2.webp)

   **`Here's How:`** This system made allowed me to fine-tune exactly what I wanted the frequency of each item to be at every level! For example, vertical play can easily be increased by modifying the spawn rate of vertical mobility items.

## design # rebalancing snowballs

One of the issues that I ran into when fine-tuning the balance of items was the difficulty of range.

Most of the high-power items required close range combat for them to get value. This was an intentional decision, because **I didn't want those behind to find an easy strategy of staying on the outskirts with high-power ranged weapons to catch up**.

However, because of the abundance of snowballs that are given to first place _(as the "coin" / "green shell" of this game)_ it became an effective strategy for whoever was in 1st place to retreat constantly while kiting opponents away with an infinite supply of snowballs.

- I couldn't simply lower the quantity of snowballs, as that would also affect those that were not in first place.
- I couldn't give too many powerful ranged options to those behind, as that would introduce camping.

So I came up with a solution that required many different adjustments, all working together:

1. ### snowballs were seperated into 2 distinct items, one was 4-count, and one was 8-count.

   I liked this change because it remained consistent within the systems of the game, without introducing confusing new rules. And it gave me the flexibility I needed to balance the item(s).

2. ### players in the lead mostly recieve 4-count snowballs, instead of the previous 8.

   This change removed the spamming power for first place, so **players have to be more careful about when they decide to use them**, but it keeps it's purpose as a "useful when used right" defensive tool.

3. ### players that are behind recieve the 8-count snowballs item, instead of snowballs being exclusive to those in the lead.

   This change gave players behind the same access to range that players in the lead have, without feeling like snowballs just wasted one of their item drops, but also without being too powerful to encourage camping.

4. ### introduce a new item, a short-ranged debuff bomb that blinds and slows victims.

   This item had enough range to impactfully increase the average threat-range of players that are behind. But **it's short range and effect still required engagement from it's user to get value**, which made it a really healthy addition to the game.

   ![A "Smoke Bomb", that applies a blind and slow effect. The blind lasts half as long as the slow](/block-sumo_14.webm)

5. ### introduce a new item, a powerful, but rare, long-ranged projectile (that works better the longer the range).

   Even with the debuff bomb and access to snowballs, players behind still don't have enough ways to make an impact when the player in 1st plays to constantly retreat to create as much distance as possible.

   Because this item is more effective at longer ranges, it's a direct counter to long distance kiting. The longer and further you retreat, the larger the threat grows that someone has gotten the projectile.

   > Ironically, an item like this actually discourages camping by forcing those in the lead to respect it's threat and think more strategically about the range they play at.

   Players can't constantly try to maximize distance between others all the time, as the item's existence introduces a sort-of "shot clock" to kiting and retreating.

## design # designing maps

and I also ensured that the map provided opportunities for such expression through the deliberate placement of platform skips and wall-climbable pillars (both of which use blocks).

# impact

As of right now, this game is not publically avaliable to play, it's currently just a passion project to **learn game design and development for competitive multiplayer games**! I also just wanted to make a game that I couldd play with my friends.

In order to grab footage for this portfolio, I hosted another playtest with a group of friends that have never played the game before, and here's what they had to say!

<Testimonials

      I've never really been the biggest fan of gimmicky PvP minigames like
      Bedwars, but this one was just... tons of fun. The items, the maps, the
      concept itself, all feels so fresh and like nothing else I've seen done in
      the engine. The game feels great to play with the items, building, and
      scoring system all coming together to create an easy-to-play,
      hard-to-master experience.
      <div class="h-4" />
      This is the most fun I've had in a Minecraft minigame in quite a long
      time, and I can't wait to play more, and to see how the game develops
      further!

      I have little to no experience with Minecraft PVP but I had tons of fun
      with this one. I didn't feel like the game was super unbalanced in favor
      of the ones with more experience, and despite all my "slipped and fell"
      moments, I managed to make it to the top of the leaderboard a few times.
      <div class="h-4" />I loved how the items were balanced out like Mario Kart,
      where if I was lagging behind a little, I'd receive really cool, powerful items
      to help me climb back up. I also enjoyed how you could adjust your playstyle
      between either being 'up in people's faces' with short-ranged weapons or good
      'ol punches, or being more laid-back, focusing on longer ranged attacks. That
      part made it a lot easier to mentally process everything going on, or to take
      a short breather when things were getting intense.
