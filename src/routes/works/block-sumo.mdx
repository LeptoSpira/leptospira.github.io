One day, while watching gameplay of a minecraft content creator (fruitberries) creatively place blocks on the edges of the map to escape his opponent, **I realized just how expressive Minecraft's movement can be**.

Placing blocks provides you with infinite possibilities for movement, allowing you to bend your environment to your will. In fact, it's not that different to Fortnite's build mode.

This is when I decided on making a minecraft minigame, one that lets gameplay like this shine.
However, I didn't want to follow the same footsteps that Fortnite had with build mode, where the skill floor grew to increasingly unreachable heights.

> I wanted a game that you know you'll enjoy when you're bored with your friends and you don't know what to play.

## design # the core concept

There were a couple design goals that I had in mind when creating the concept for the game.

1. The game should **highlight creative block placement** and allow players to access a near-infinite level of skill expression.
2. At the same time, anyone regardless of experience should be able to **pick up the game and find it instantly enjoyable** and fun.
3. The fundamental mechanics of the game should have lots of **game mode flexibility**, it should be easy to support ffa's, 1v1s, teams, and asymmetric modes. No matter who you're hanging out with, there should always be a fitting gamemode to play together.

I also want the game to have a **chaotic, party-like energy to the game's atmosphere** in a way that feels both **strategic and chaotic in equal proportions**. This all lead me to this main concept.

> You spawn on a floating platform, and your goal is to knock other players off to score points. Items randomly spawn for all players, with more powerful items to help those who fall behind.
>
> The catch? **Each player has an infinite number of blocks in their offhand!**

This concept was just simple enough for anyone to intuitive grasp the objective, so it was easy to pick up. It also had a lot of flexibility what game modes can be set! You can easily turn a 6-person free-for-all into 2 teams of 3, or 3 teams of 2.

![Infinite blocks provide a lot of creativity for movement and outplays](/block-sumo_10.webm)

## design # rubber-banding items

I wanted items to **assist players with less direct mechanical skill to be able to find success through the strategic use of items**, that way players far behind still have a sense of agency and ability to make an impact on the game.

I also wanted to **force more mechanically skilled players to be more active to preserve their lead**, to make the game more engaging and active.

> Players recieve more powerful items the further behind they are.

![Use your items strategically to claw your way back up!](/block-sumo_13.webm)

While the main role of items is to lower the skill floor, they also have a lot of utility as a tool that I can use to influence the atmosphere of the game!

> By fine-tuning the exact frequency of items at every level, I have a lot of control over the atmosphere and the level of rubber-banding.

# iteration

<Topic design>

## design # a scoring system that rewards aggression

I wanted a scoring system that rewarded players for going in for kills, without having too much risk if they happen to not succeed.

One of the biggest problems with limited lives in a free-for-all system is that it **prioritizes survival over getting kills**, which made it not ideal for my vision of the game.

At the same time, having no penalty would have the inverse effect by allowing players to kill themselves to escape giving kill credit.

> I decided on a time-based system with infinite lives, \
> where players get **`+2` points for kills**, and **`-1` points for deaths**.

## design # dropping items on death while avoiding a wealth gap

I wanted it to be important that players are able to target other players in an attempt to remove their items if they succeed in killing them.

However, **I predicted that simply making all items drop on death would cause a snowball effect**. Where a player in the lead could maintain control and accumulate more items over time, while players behind, having just respawned and lost all their items, will be at a significant disadvantage when trying to come back.

> The % of items you lose decreases the further you are behind. So a player in the lead would lose 100% of their items, while a player in last only loses 12.5%.

## design # item combos, but not item stockpiles

When it came to the mechanics of utilizing items, It was important to me that **players are able to experiment with using multiple items together to create synergistic combos**.

At the same time, I didn't want players being able to stockpile infinite number items, and encourage them to use items before it's too late.

> Players can hold up to 8 items at a time. If a player is already holding 8, they won't be able to recieve new items.

## design # preserving counterplay for players in the lead

Although I wanted the game to be easy to pick up and play with friends, I didn't want to take away from the skill expression of block placement.

Even the most powerful items should have enough counterplay **for players at the top to use their better mechanics to outplay them**.

> Players in the lead still has access to less powerful defensive items to help defend against an assault.

With a combination of better mechanics and **being resourceful with the items you do have**, players in the lead can find the right counterplay to any situation.

![No matter what gets thrown your way, there's always room to clutch](/block-sumo_16.webm)

## design # encouraging emergent vertical mobility

I wanted vertical movement as a staple of the game, where **traversing up and down feels seamless and fluid**. The game should play in a 3-dimensional space, not a 2-dimensional plane, and movement should feel dynamic and expressive.

> I was able to fulfill that 3d combat space fantasy by introducing a plethora of different quick-cast vertical mobility items.

# impact

This game is a passion project to help me **learn game design and development for competitive multiplayer games**.
In order to grab footage for this portfolio, I hosted many playtest sessions with my friends!

It was a really fun experience, and it provided me with some really valuable feedback as well!

<Topic design>

## design # addressing feedback: an inbalance of player ranges

During one of the first playtests, one of the main points I heard was how it felt really difficult to find ways to approach or close the distance when you were mid-far behind. So I looked into this!

Because of my use of **snowballs as the main "filler item" for those in the lead**, it became an effective strategy for whoever was in 1st place to retreat constantly while kiting opponents away with an infinite supply of snowballs.

This was exacerbated because **many of the high-power items required close range combat** for them to get value. _(This was an intentional decision, because I didn't want those behind to find an easy strategy of staying on the outskirts with high-power ranged weapons to catch up)_.

I couldn't simply lower the global quantity of snowballs, as that would disproportionately affect those that weren't in first place who needed them more. But something needed to be done to curb the amount of snowballs that first place got.

**So my solution involved many additions and adjustments, all working together:**

1. ### introduce a new item: a short-ranged debuff bomb that blinds and slows victims.

   This item had enough range to impactfully increase the average threat-range of players that are behind. But **it's short range and effect still required engagement from it's user to get value**, which made it a really healthy addition to the game.

   ![A "Smoke Bomb", that applies a blind and slow effect. The blind lasts half as long as the slow](/block-sumo_14.webm)

1. ### introduce a new item: a powerful, but rare, long-ranged projectile (that's more effective at further ranges).

   Even with the debuff bomb and access to snowballs, players behind still don't have enough ways to make an impact when the player in 1st plays to constantly retreat to create as much distance as possible.

   **Because this item is more effective at longer ranges, it's a direct counter to long distance kiting**. The longer and further you retreat, the larger the threat grows that someone has gotten the projectile.

   > Ironically, an item like this actually discourages camping by forcing those in the lead to respect it's threat and think more strategically about the range they play at.

   Players can't constantly try to maximize distance between others all the time, as the item's existence **introduces a sort-of "shot clock" to kiting and retreating**.

   !["The Obliterator", a rocket-launcher that instantly kills anyone caught in it's blast radius](/block-sumo_15.webm)

1. ### split up the quantity of snowballs so that players in the lead mostly recieve 4-count, while players behind recieve 8-count.

   Last but not least, the root of the problem itself. By splitting snowballs into two seperate items, I was able to keep this change consistent within the systems of the game, without introducing entirely new rules.

   For those in the lead, this change removed the spamming power for first place, so **players in the lead have to be more intentional about when they decide to use them**, but it keeps it's purpose as a "useful when used right" defensive tool.

   Providing 8-count snowballs to those behind **gave those players the same access to range that players in the lead have**, without feeling like snowballs just wasted one of their item drops with a meager 4.

Through these changes, I was able to successfully resolve this issue! During my second official playtest, my friends felt a lot more flexible in how they wanted to play, even if they were behind!

      I've never really been the biggest fan of gimmicky PvP minigames like
      Bedwars, but this one was just... tons of fun. The items, the maps, the
      concept itself, all feels so fresh and like nothing else I've seen done in
      the engine. The game feels great to play with the items, building, and
      scoring system all coming together to create an easy-to-play,
      hard-to-master experience.
      <div class="h-4" />
      This is the most fun I've had in a Minecraft minigame in quite a long
      time, and I can't wait to play more, and to see how the game develops
      further!

      I have little to no experience with Minecraft PVP but I had tons of fun
      with this one. I didn't feel like the game was super unbalanced in favor
      of the ones with more experience, and despite all my "slipped and fell"
      moments, I managed to make it to the top of the leaderboard a few times.
      <div class="h-4" />I loved how the items were balanced out like Mario Kart,
      where if I was lagging behind a little, I'd receive really cool, powerful items
      to help me climb back up. I also enjoyed how you could adjust your playstyle
      between either being 'up in people's faces' with short-ranged weapons or good
      'ol punches, or being more laid-back, focusing on longer ranged attacks. That
      part made it a lot easier to mentally process everything going on, or to take
      a short breather when things were getting intense.
