      <p>
        i was tasked with building a set of broadcast graphics for a splatoon
        major tournament 5 days before the event. it included a unique
        "showdown" scene for finals day, with custom map states such as
        pick/ban, and a leaderboard scene.
      </p>
      <p>
        in addition to the overlays, i also created an external website with a
        live data api to showcase a live updating interactive leaderboard 24/7!
        this data api could then be accessed by my overlays to make my
        leaderboard scene work!

# 48 hours remain

Take a look at some of the early designs:

![](/fabl_3.webp)

**Just kidding!**, that's a lie. These weren't the early designs, these were the final designs that the designer left me with.

Unfortunately, there were unforeseen external factors that meant the designer wasn't able to finish polishing the final designs, before the first week started.

> So now I had to take over and ensure the designs reached the finish line

Remember! All of this is happening **48 hours before broadcast day**, and I had to:

- **Completing the markup** for the designs.
- **Polishing the designs** myself, so that it's professional enough to be shown on stream.
- **Designing my own animations and layout transitions**, and then implementing them.
- **Rigging the graphics** up to the dashboard so it can be controlled.
- _(Attending my sister's volleyball tournament! yep...)_

One of the biggest challenges in this step was implementing all of the parts that were not part of the original design specification, such as how **the maplist should show completed games**.

<Topic design>

## design # improving the rosters scene

I put a lot of thought into the layout and hierarchy of information, I wanted the placement of all the elements to make sense.

In this case I felt like the commentator box had a lot of interest and pop going into it. I felt like the interest **should draw the eye to the heading with relevant broadcast information**, rather than to what commentators were currently speaking.

Once I moved the logo to the top, the rest of the design just fell into place, I just needed to restructure the design to suit the new placement.

## design # fancy layout transitions

The heading adapts to the content height by shifting up and down to ensure that the content below is evenly spaced! While the text inside fades to showcase whatever is relevant for the active page.

## design # animation treats on the in-game scene!

i made some **bouncy icons on the scoreboard**! They were actually not part of the original design specification, I just thought it would be really cool while finishing up all the rest of the animations! I think I made the right call.

# impact

The event went over the course of 6 weeks, with a total streaming time of `17h 31m`, averaging about `40` viewers per stream!

I ended up still working on all of the animations and stuff even as the event was going on, it must have been funny for the viewers to watch the graphics get progressively better as the tournament went on.
