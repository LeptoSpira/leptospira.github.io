<CaseDivider />

Internal tool used to organize tournaments, manage signups and organize participants. Completely rewritten and redesigned from the ground up. Used Python, Discord.py, MongoDB, GraphQL, REST.

queries from google calendar
the purpose of this was because the legacy tool didn't support multiple tournaments

This is my rewrite from scratch!
