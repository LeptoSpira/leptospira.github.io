      <p>
        i redesigned and rebuild a tournament management tool from the ground up
        to give staff members a more delightful user experience, and meet
        growing business requirements of an expanding tournament organization.
      </p>
      <p>
        features include managing multiple tournaments simultaneously through an
        agenda, pulling tournament data from the google calendar api.

{/* todo: make case study */}
When a single tournament operation wanted to expand into a full
organization and start hosting multiple tournaments, their internal tool

queries from google calendar
the purpose of this was because the legacy tool didn't support multiple tournaments

This is my rewrite from scratch!
