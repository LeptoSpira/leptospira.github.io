im not a graphic designer

but you see that clam that the host camera is cropped in?

making that thing turned out to be a trip to hell and back

![](/cg-pass-the-clam_5.webp)

u see that image

that's every file i tried exported that day

or had to open

and half of those exports is illustrator deciding to shit itself

here's an example

![](cg-pass-the-clam_8.webp)

of the shit i was working with

all because i wanted a frame of a clam

to put a camera inside for a game show

first i go to get a very legal copy of adobe illustrator EXCLUSIVELY to make this clam

i open up the original .ai file that included the clam image used on the map screen

it's like 120 px

my source material was a 120 px

you might think i could just raster export it with higher def

yeah i tried to do that 100 different times

but illustrator loses all semblance of capability as soon as you put a pattern in that shadow.

so i have to scale it up manually

but scaling it up breaks everything because remember that striped shadow pattern?

yeah illustrator doesn't even scale that up

thats a seperate fucking thing that needs to be scaled seperately

i never used illustrator before

so i had to dig thru every single context menu

(there are a lot of context menus)

to try to find out how to increase the scale of the fill pattern

which i somehow FOUND

and it wasn't just a number

it was it's own canvas i had to change the size of manually

to scale the pattern, you also had to manually drag out those rectangles

but what if i want it to scale proportionally? adobe says fuck you

so i had to save the shadow canvas and compare it to a screenshot of the 120px clam

and then i had to keep doing that 200 times and keep eyeballing it dragging the little rectangle corners 2 pixels at a time

until finally the shadow is kinda the same sorta scale

THEN I REALIZE THE DOTS ARE THEIR OWN EFFECT

so i had to scale up the radius of those dots too

but that's not a shadow, it's something completely different

dug thru 200 more context menus to find that

i had to scale that one up by typing in arbitrary radius and padding numbers 200 different times

then i tried to export it and adobe decides to export the svgs as images???

so i can't mask individual things anymore

so i fill it in with green cuz why not

then i realize that there's a dot effect on the green fill

but did you know that theres literally zero fucking way to remove that?

so i have to COPY the ENTIRE psd file, one with just the green and one with the pattern, and export BOTH

but all of a sudden the layout of everything just goes to shit??? the 2 files just does not align

like all i did was remove an effect and the whole layout shifts ??

so i literally open up the SOURCE CODE OF THE SVG IN MY TEXT EDITOR

TO COMPARE THE PROPERTIES MANUALLY

AND FIND WHAT IS MISSING

AND GUESS WHAT

![](cg-pass-the-clam_6.webp)

THIS

ADOBE JUST FUCKING IGNORES THIS FOR ONE OF THEM

LIKE WHAT THE FUCK

anyway while im doing it i realize "wait a minute"

"this is.. an svg now"

so it turns out the reason the whole layout shifted is because now it's an svg and not a webp

and adding a pattern effect is the reason illustrator cant export as an svg

SO THE 2nd IMAGE ACTUALLY BECOMES AN SVG WHEN I REMOVE THE EFFECT

AND SO THE LAYOUT SHIFTS CUZ ILLUSTRATOR CANT BE EXPECTED TO EVEN EXPORT THE SAME THING ACROSS DIFFERENT FILE TYPES

anyway so then i realize

since it's actually an svg path now i can get rid of the green screen and actually mask

so then i take the svg

and throw it into lunacy

and then spent 30 minutes playing with masks and stuff to try to get it to hide the inside shadow

![](cg-pass-the-clam_7.webp)

turns out that's a lot harder than i thought and the end result is insane

i had to duplicate part of the clam and fill it in first

then i added a new rectangle around the whole thing

then i use the 'subtract' union on both of those images

then i use that as a mask for the shadow part

then i take the original clam and put it on top

ok anyway i export the svg from lunacy

that means that i exported an svg from illustrator then put that in lunacy and then exported it again from lunacy

i plop it in my code and it works and im happy

and then i spent the next hour nit picking it

like changing the stroke width and stuff

anyway

after all of that work i finally put the finished clam into the graphics

and i also told my struggle to the team

was it worth it

probably not

it looks sick tho

but you want to know the cherry on top
