im not a graphic designer

but you see that clam that the host camera is cropped in?

making that thing turned out to be a trip to hell and back

all because they wanted a frame of a clam

to put a camera inside for a game show

![](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1029264206081572905/1103539203733733396/image.png)

first i had to get a very legal copy of adobe illustrator EXCLUSIVELY to make this clam

then open up the original .ai file that included the clam image used on the map screen

it's like 120 px

my source material was a 120 px

you might think i could just raster export it with higher def

but that illustrator loses all semblance of capability as soon as you put a pattern in that shadow.

so i have to scale it up manually

scaling it up breaks everything because u remember the pattern in the shadow?

yeah illustrator doesn't even scale that up

i never used illustrator before

so i had to dig thru every single context menue

(there are a lot of context menus)

to try to find out how to increase the scale of the fill pattern

which i somehow FOUND

and it wasn't just a number

it was it's own canvas i had to change the size of manually

to scale the pattern, you also had to manually drag out those rectangles

so i had to manually eye-pick play around with it to try to get the same sorta scale

THEN I REALIZE THE DOTS ARE THEIR OWN EFFECT

so i had to scale up the radius of those dots too

dug thru a bunch more to find that

then i tried to export it and adobe decides to export the svgs as images???

so i can't mask individual things anymore

so i fill it in with green cuz why not

then i realize that there's a dot effect on the green fill

so i have to remove that ; reexport

all of a sudden the layout of everything just goes to shit

like all i did was remove an effect and the whole layout shifts ??

when i export

so i literally open up the svg in VSCODE

TO COPY PASTE THE PROPERTIES THAT DIDNT MAKE IT OVER

INTO THE RIGHT LINES

THIS

LIKE WHAT THE FUCK

anyway while im doing it i realize "wait a minute"

"this is.. an svg now"

so it turns out the reason the whole layout shifted is because now it's an svg and not a png

and adding a pattern effect is the reason illustrator cant export as an svg

SO THE 2nd IMAGE ACTUALLY BECOMES AN SVG WHEN I REMOVE THE EFFECT

AND SO THE LAYOUT SHIFTS CUZ ILLUSTRATOR CANT EVEN BE EXPORT THE SAME THING ACROSS FILE TYPES

anyway so then i realize

since it's actually an svg path now i can get rid of the green screen and actually mask

so then i take the svg

and throw it into lunacy

and then spent 30 minutes playing with masks and stuff to try to get it to hide the inside shadow

![](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1029264206081572905/1103540844126023742/image.png)

turns out that's a lot harder than i thought and the end result is insane

i had to duplicate part of the clam and fill it in first

then i added a new rectangle around the whole thing

then i use the 'subtract' union on both of those images

then i use that as a mask for the shadow part

then i take the original clam and put it on top

ok anyway i export the svg from lunacy

that means that i exported an svg from illustrator then put that in lunacy and then exported it again from lunacy

i plop it in my code and it works and im happy

and then i spent the next 4 hours nit picking it

like changing the stroke width and stuff

u see that image that i sent at the very top

that's every file i exported today

or had to open

and half of those exports is illustrator deciding to shit itself

here's an example

![](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1029264206081572905/1103541598412869732/image.png)

of the shit i'm working with

how am i supposed to

anyway

after all of that work i finally put the finished clam into the graphics

and i also told my struggle to the team

was it worth it

probably not

it looks sick tho

but you want to know the cherry on top
