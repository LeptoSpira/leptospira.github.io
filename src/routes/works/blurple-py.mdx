      <>
        One day, I realized a lot of complex features I implemented for a
        different project could be useful to others, if the API design was
        extracted, generalized, refactored, and published as a library. So
        that's exactly what I did. Features include a multi-step commands, a
        consistent design system, and automatic toasts.

# an extensible system for multi-step commands

```py
@router.route(["reply", "message"])
async def message(ctx):
    await ctx.send("Enter a number.")

One of the main features of this library is the multi-step reply functions, these make it really easy for developers to create back-and-forth interactions. I also needed it to support message validation as well!

> I called it **The Reply System**

I needed a system that could be designed in a way that made it easy for developers to use as a drop-in solution for standard use cases. I also wanted the system to be extensible, so it can support developers who need to implement their own custom functionality.

<Topic engineering>

## engineering # how it works

The default abstract `Reply` class contains hooks for each relevant part of the interaction. Examples include `on_reply_init` for when the command is first initialized, and `on_reply_attempt` to handle resetting state after a reply attempt.

- A `Reply` object stores all the data nessecary for the interaction, but initializing it does not start the interaction.
- To actually start the interaction, the user must await the `result()` coroutine method.

I specialized default subclasses for different use cases, including `MessageReply` and `ReactionAddReply`.

- The `MessageReply` class checks if the message author matches up, as well as the channel ids. It also automatically deletes all reply attempts.
- the `ReactionAddReply` class ensures that the message author matches up, as well as the response's message matches up with the reaction's message.

<Topic design>

## design # user flows

Users can use the built-in `MessageReply` inline with their code to wait for a reply within any normal command!

```py
reply = await io.MessageReply(ctx).result()
```

To add validation to any reply object, simply include the `validate` parameter. It can take in a regex, list of responses, or function for more complex validations:

```py
reply = await io.MessageReply(ctx, validate=r'^[0-9]{1,}$').result()
reply = await io.MessageReply(ctx, validate=['yes', 'no']).result()
reply = await io.MessageReply(ctx, validate=(lambda r: r.content.startswith("ahem"))).result()
```

If users require modifying behavior for any reason, they can create their own `Reply` subclass and hook into the events to add custom behavior

```py
class DirectMessageReactionAddReply(ReactionAddBasic):
    """A subclass for the ReactionAddReply that's safe to use in Direct Messages."""

    async def on_reply_init(self, message: discord.Message):
        await super().on_reply_init(message)
        if self._iscontainer(self.validate):
            for react in self.validate:
                await self.message.add_reaction(react)

    def reply_check(self, payload: discord.RawReactionActionEvent):
        return payload.user_id == self.ctx.author.id and \
               payload.message_id == self.message.id
```

# awaiting multiple replies simultaneously

What if the user wants to wait for **a reaction _or_ a reply**?

I built a function that allows you to await multiple results at the same time, and then gets whichever one completes first, before cancelling the rest!

![](/blurple-py_6.webm)

<figcaption class="-mt-[1em]">

```py
@router.route(["reply", "multiple"])
async def multiple(ctx):
    message = await ctx.send("React or send a message")
    reply, result = await io.Reply.result_between({
        io.MessageReply(ctx),
        io.ReactionAddReply(ctx, validate=['‚òëÔ∏è','üîò'], message=message)
    })
    await ctx.send(embed=ui.Alert(ui.Style.SUCCESS, reply, io.Reply._get_reply_content(result)))
```

<Topic engineering>

## engineering # how it works

The function is a class method that takes in a list of `Reply` objects as it's arguments, and manages how each of the `.result()` methods are called independently with asyncio tasks!

What makes this feature so special is how easy it was to implement due to the flexibility of the Reply system! Because the `Reply` object is decoupled from starting the interaction with `await reply.result()`, but still holds all of the nessecary information. It gives us lot of flexibility to modify the behavior of Replies to do exactly what we want!

Here's the entire source code of the [`result_between()`](https://github.com/cysabi/blurple.py/blob/main/blurple/io/reply.py#L152) method:

```py
@classmethod
async def result_between(cls, replies: t.Container[Reply]) -> t.Tuple[Reply, t.Any]:
    # Timeouts are handled by the _wait_tasks function
    timeouts = []

    def parse_task(reply: Reply):
        # Extract the timeout out of the reply object
        timeouts.append(reply.timeout)
        reply.timeout = None
        # Create task!!
        return asyncio.create_task(reply.result(), name=reply)

    # Build task list
    tasks = [parse_task(task) for task in replies]
    # _wait_tasks is a low-level function that interfaces with asyncio
    task, result = await cls._wait_tasks(tasks, timeout=min(timeouts))

    # Get original reply object, or None if it's timed out
    for obj in replies:
        if task is None:
            obj = None
            break
        if str(obj) == task.get_name():
            break
    # Run cleanup on cancelled replies
    replies.remove(obj)
    for cancelled in replies:
        await cancelled._cleanup()

    # Return original reply object and the result
    return obj, result
```

## design # user flows

It's easy to convert an existing command into one that awaits 2 at the same time! Simply cut the `.result()` call on your `Reply` objects, pass a list of them into `result_between`, and await!

Here's an example of an rsvp command by waiting for 2 different reaction events:

```py
rsvp_react = "üìù"
rsvp_list = []

# Create RSVP message
message = await ctx.send("React to RSVP!")
await message.add_reaction(rsvp_react)

# Create both reaction events
add = io.ReactionAddBasic(message, validate=[rsvp_react])
remove = io.ReactionRemoveBasic(message, validate=[rsvp_react])

while True:
    # Await both reply objects!
    obj, result = await io.Reply.result_between({add, remove})
    # result_between passes whichever obj succeeds, which is useful for checks like this
    if obj is add:
        rsvp_list.append(result.user_id)
    elif obj is remove:
        rsvp_list.remove(result.user_id)
    else:  # obj is None (The reply timed out)
        break

# Reply wait complete
await message.clear_reactions()
await message.edit(
  f"Here's the list of RSVPrs:\n{'\n'.join([f'> <@{user_id}>' for user_id in rsvp_list])}")
```

# implementing toasts in discord

I wanted the toast to automatically delete itself after a certain period of time, but also have a way to close the toast early. Toast behavior in discord sounds like a pretty complex task!

Well, the systems I built were flexible enough to make implementing toasts a breeze!

![](/blurple-py_4.webm)

<figcaption class="-mt-[1em]">

```py
@router.route(["toast"])
async def toast(ctx):
    await ui.Toast(ui.Style.INFO, f"This is a toast!").send(ctx)
```

</figcaption>

In fact, the total line count for [toast.py](https://github.com/cysabi/blurple.py/blob/main/blurple/ui/toast.py) is just **_60 lines of code!_**, including all documentation and whitespace! That's the difference designing a well thought out API makes.

<Topic engineering>

## engineering # how it works

- I first created a subclass of `ReactionAddBasic` called `ToastInteraction`.

  - Specialize the `on_reply_init()` method to add a dismiss reaction, and set the validation list to only validate the dismiss reaction.
  - Specialize the `on_reply_complete()` method to delete the message, this function runs on timeout as well, but has `None` as the reply variable.

  ```py
  class ToastInteraction(io.ReactionAddBasic):
    """A custom toast interaction reply subclass."""

    async def on_reply_init(self, message: discord.Message):
        await super().on_reply_init(message)
        self.dismiss = "\u2716\ufe0f"
        self.validate = [self.dismiss]
        await self.message.add_reaction(self.dismiss)

    def reply_check(self, payload: discord.RawReactionActionEvent):
        return super().reply_check(payload) and payload.user_id == self.ctx.author.id

    async def on_reply_complete(self):
        await self.message.delete()
  ```

- Then, I built a class called `Toast`. It inherits a `ui.Base` class that has one async method, `send()` which sends the component to a channel.
  - Specialize the `send()` method to create an asyncio task of `ToastInteraction(...).result()`, passing in the message, and a 5-second timeout duration (by default)

And that's it! That's all the code you need to build a toast component with blurple.py.

# a recursive router

Something you may have noticed in my code captions is the `router` decorator! I never really liked the way discord.ext made you define commands. It forced you to put commands in cogs, and all the commands of a command group must be in the same class.

I had an idea to create a custom command router that allowed you to specify the command as a route, similar to web frameworks. And that's what I did! The way the router class works is by recursively searching for the relevant command group, or creating the nessecary command group(s) if they don't already exist.

I'm really happy with how clean the user-facing API is, and how concise the router code is (less than [60 lines](https://github.com/cysabi/blurple.py/blob/main/blurple/ext/router.py))!

```py
@router.route(["reply", "message"])
async def command(ctx):
```

# impact

I didn't do any advertising, but somehow a couple people found the library and expressed their delight with how thoughtful the API design was! [One user](https://patchwork.systems) actually used it when building a discord bot for a server with 30k members! That felt pretty cool.

This library might be the bit of python code that I'm most proud of, I put a ton of care into the code quality and api design, and I used a ton of clever ways to make the code I wrote clean and concise! These were just the highlights, I hope you found it cool!

If you're interested to read more about API design, one of the best blog posts I've ever read _(OF ALL TIME, not just related to api design)_ is [Stripe's payments APIs: The first 10 years](https://stripe.com/blog/payment-api-design) by **Michelle Bu**, an absolutely golden piece.
