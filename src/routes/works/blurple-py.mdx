While making my Off the Dial bot, there was a lot of complex features that I implemented. I realized that a lot of the code could be useful to others if it was extracted, generalized, refactored, and published as a library, so that's exactly what I did.

## designing an extensible system for developers of multi-step commands

![The reply system in action](/blurple-py_5.webm)

One of the main features of this library is the multi-step reply functions, these make it really easy for developers to create back-and-forth interactions. I also needed it to support message validation as well!

I needed a system that could be designed in a way that made it easy for developers to use as a drop-in solution for standard use cases. I also wanted the system to be extensible, so it can support developers who need to implement their own custom functionality.

#### Here's the system I came up with!

- There is a default abstract `Reply` class that contains hooks for each relevant part of the interaction, such as when the command is first initialized, or when a user's message hits the validation check.
  - In order to actually start the interaction, there's an awaitable method on the class called `result()` that intializes the interaction.
- Then, I implemented a `MessageReply` class that has sensible defaults for each of these events, it checks if the message author is valid, and it automatically deletes invalid responses.
- I also implemented classes for different events, such as `ReactionAddBasic`

### showcasing the power of blurple #1: extra features made easy

Because the `Reply` object is decoupled from starting the interaction with `await reply.result()`, it gives us lot of flexibility to modify the behavior of Replies to do exactly what we want!

For example, I built a function called [`result_between()`](https://github.com/cysabi/blurple.py/blob/main/blurple/io/reply.py#L152) that allows you to await multiple results at the same time, and then gets whichever one completes first, before cancelling the rest. This is only possible because of the afformentioned decoupling, as the function works by taking a list of `Reply` objects as it's arguments, before independently managing asyncio tasks on how each of the `.result()` methods are called!

### showcasing the power of blurple #2: creating toasts in discord

A component that I wanted to implement in discord was toasts! Toast behavior in discord sounds like a pretty complex task! I wanted the toast to automatically delete itself after a certain period of time, but also have a way to close the toast early.

Luckily, the systems I built were flexible enough to make implementing toasts a breeze!

![](/blurple-py_4.webm)

In fact, the total line count for [toast.py](https://github.com/cysabi/blurple.py/blob/main/blurple/ui/toast.py) is just **_60 lines of code!_**, including all documentation and whitespace! That's the difference designing a well thought out API makes.

#### Here's how it works:

- I first created a subclass of `ReactionAddBasic` called `ToastInteraction`.
  - Specialize the `on_reply_init()` method to add a dismiss reaction, and set the validation list to only validate the dismiss reaction.
  - Specialize the `on_reply_complete()` method to delete the message, this function runs on timeout as well, but has `None` as the reply variable.
- Then, I built a class called `Toast`. It inherits a `ui.Base` class that has one async method, `send()` which sends the component to a channel.

  - Specialize the `send()` method to create an asyncio task of `ToastInteraction(...).result()`, passing in the message, and a 5-second timeout duration (by default)

  And that's it! That's all the code needed to build a toast component with blurple.py

## a recursive router

I never really liked the way discord.ext made you define commands. It forced you to put commands in cogs, and all the commands of a command group must be in the same class.

I had an idea to create a custom command router that allowed you to specify the command as a route, similar to web frameworks. And that's what I did! The way the router class works is by recursively searching for the relevant command group, or creating the nessecary command group(s) if they don't already exist.

I'm really happy with how clean the user-facing API is, and how concise the router code is (less than [60 lines](https://github.com/cysabi/blurple.py/blob/main/blurple/ext/router.py))!

```
@router.route(["reply", "message"])
async def command(ctx):
```

---

This library might be the bit of python code that I'm most proud of, I put a ton of care into the code quality and api design, but I also used a ton of clever tricks to make my code more cleaner and more concise! These were just the highlights, I hope you found it cool!
