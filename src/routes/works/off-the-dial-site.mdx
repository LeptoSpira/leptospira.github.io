        After noticing players having difficulty finding information surrounding
        tournaments, I set out to build a website that could stand as the single
        source of truth for everything Off the Dial. This quest would end up
        going through 5 iterations spanning across 5 years.

}

At the time, there were a couple problems

- registration was hosted by a discord bot, which was cumbersome and complicated
- hosting on a discord bot meant limitations that tournament organisers had to fix manually.
  There were a couple of design goals that I needed to solve
- provide an easy link to rules that can be shared and edited without hassle
- have live and reliable active season information
- let users sign up and input data, doing as much client side form validation so to's don't need to parse bad data
- give users a personal dashboard to see their signup status
- allow players to know what time it is in the tournament schedule

### design: a source of truth for the idtga page

- one of the iterations had a schedule on the idtga page
  - it was moved inside rules for a source of truth
  - then a timezone specific schedule in on your profil

Even though the rules page would be the single source of truth about the tournament as a whole, I wanted all season information in it's own source of truth as well, and that came in the form of a card!

I wanted this card to be what users can refer to whenever they need information about the current season.
The focal point of this card directly shares with the user the status of the tournament _as it relates to them!_

The card also displays the season title, and all important dates for the season. It shows any information about the season that tournament organizers want to share, such as updates to the rules. And of course, the card also has the rules and signup button!

### engineering: max-width is cool

Something else special about this page in specific is the dynamic size of the skateboarding octo!

![](/off-the-dial-site_3.webm "controls")

I can't just apply a max-width to it (like the one below) because the right side needs to be aligned to the right of the viewport, and the left needs to be inline with the padding of all the other elements on the page.

So I used the `calc()` function from css!

> `max-width: calc(36rem + 50vw)`

## design: profile page

One of the biggest improvements I made to the design was the profile page. The old profile page simply displayed your signal strength, but as the year went on, I realized there were some design problems that users wanted solved.

One of these was being able to have a good idea on the timing of the tournament.

Because it's an international tournament that caters to multiple timezones, it can be difficult to know when it actually runs. In the earlier design, I had a schedule table on the /idtga page, but that was it.

For the rewrite, I removed the schedule table and designed a timeline that would be visible on the profile page. The timeline would be dynamic, timezone-specific, season-specific, and profile-specific.

Anyone who navigates to their profile will be able to essentially see a dashboard letting them know if there's a tournament going on, the timing on when everything happens, and what they should be doing right now!

I also placed a non-timezone specific schedule in the rules page, that way all of the "official" information about the tournament is coming from one source of truth, not inside the idtga page.

## both: weapons selector

One of the new additions for this rewrite was a working weapon selector. No fancy tricks were really used here, but I'm really proud of the finished design.

This was when I first discovered [`match-sorter`](https://github.com/kentcdodds/match-sorter), a really cool library! Learning how to implement that into [`headlessui`](https://headlessui.com)'s combobox was just really satsifying.
