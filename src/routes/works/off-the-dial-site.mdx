# ideation

## problems

Previously, registration was hosted through a discord bot. This caused a couple of issues for players and tournament organisers.

- Players would run into a lot of friction when attempting to register for tournaments, as it was cumbersome and unintuitive.
- Tournament organisers had to manually validate and fix problematic signups due to limitations in the registration process.
- Information and rules surrounding the tournament was difficult to host and share.

## goals

I was able to solve these design problems by **building a website that provides a single source of truth and action for Off the Dial**.

- Registration on the website must be a frictionless process for players, and be reliably validated for tournament organisers.
- Players should be presented with relevant tournament information without needing to search for it.

## solutions

In order to satisfy the goal of presenting relevant information, **I conceputalized all of Off the Dial's information into 3 main categories**.

- The Constitution
  - The rules page is a purely static / immutable document detailing the technical rules of the tournament and the general schedule.
- The Season
  - The tournament page includes details on the start dates, and registration dates for the current season of the tournament.
- The Player
  - The profile page displays a player's signup status for the current season, and encourages them to register for the upcoming season.
  - During the event, a timeline displays what the player's responsibility is for the currently active phase of the event.

# iteration

## engineering: the process

Because Off the Dial is a grassroots tournament organization, it was imperative that I be as efficient with costs as possible. At the same time, I didn't want to sacrifice being able to build any feature.

After researching differentt web hosting methods, I settled on using a jamstack website with the following technologies.

- GatsbyJS - A free and open source static site generator, that allows me to build the website with React.
- Github Pages - A free CDN, that hosts the static website that GatsbyJS builds.
- Google Firebase - A basically-free BaaS, that hosts all dynamic functionalities, including OAuth2 login with Firebase Functions.

I also built automated CI pipelines for deployment, completely free with Github Actions.

## design: a source of truth for the idtga page

Previously, one of the iteration of the IDTGA page included a schedule at the bottom of the page that showed the dates of the season.

![](/off-the-dial-site_13.png)

However, players were oftentimes confused

- one of the iterations had a schedule on the idtga page
  - it was moved inside rules for a source of truth
  - then a timezone specific schedule in on your profile

Even though the rules page would be the single source of truth about the tournament as a whole, I wanted all season information in it's own source of truth as well, and that came in the form of a card!

![](/off-the-dial-site_6.png)

I wanted this card to be what players can refer to whenever they need information about the current season.
The focal point of this card directly shares with the player the status of the tournament _as it relates to them!_

The card also displays the season title, and all important dates for the season. It shows any information about the season that tournament organizers want to share, such as updates to the rules. And of course, the card also has the rules and signup button!

## engineering: a max-width container that extends to one side

Something else special about the idtga page is the dynamic size of the skateboarding octo!
Unlike the max-width container below, the right side needs to extend to edge of the viewport. But the left side needs to remain consistent in padding to all of the other elements on the page.

![](/off-the-dial-site_3.webm "controls")

How do you do this? You can conceputalize the image into 2 halves, where the left half is simply half of the max-width container, while the right half fills it's entire side of the viewport.

Thus, if you divide the container width by 2 and add `50vw` (half of the viewport), all that's left is to align the container to the right!

I used the `calc()` css function to do this! Here's the final rule: `max-width: calc(36rem + 50vw)`

## design: profile page

One of the biggest improvements I made to the design was the profile page. The old profile page simply displayed your signal strength, but as the year went on, I realized there were some design problems that players wanted solved.

One of these was being able to have a good idea on the timing of the tournament.

Because it's an international tournament that caters to multiple timezones, it can be difficult to know when it actually runs. In the earlier design, I had a schedule table on the /idtga page, but that was it.

For the rewrite, I removed the schedule table and designed a timeline that would be visible on the profile page. The timeline would be dynamic, timezone-specific, season-specific, and profile-specific.

![](/off-the-dial-site_5.png)

Anyone who navigates to their profile will be able to essentially see a dashboard letting them know if there's a tournament going on, the timing on when everything happens, and what they should be doing right now!

# impact

- the website makes it much easier for attendees to find tournament information, as it's the single source of truth for everything
  - quote attendees on how they feel about the website in general
  - metric states that most attendees use the website as their go to place to get season information
    - quote a specific player
  - metric states that 99% of attendees use the profile page during tournament weekend to see what they need to do
    - quote a specific player
  - 99% of attendees are satisifed with navigating the website
    - quote a specific player

---

I also placed a non-timezone specific schedule in the rules page, that way all of the "official" information about the tournament is coming from one source of truth, not inside the idtga page.

## both: weapons selector

![](/off-the-dial-site_4.png)

One of the new additions for this rewrite was a working weapon selector. No fancy tricks were really used here, but I'm really proud of the finished design.

This was when I first discovered [`match-sorter`](https://github.com/kentcdodds/match-sorter), a really cool library! Learning how to implement that into [`headlessui`](https://headlessui.com)'s combobox was just really satsifying.
