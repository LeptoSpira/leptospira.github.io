### the circumstance

This was the the first time that I was working with a designer to make the set of
broadcast graphics! I had a very short timeframe to implement the designs, with about
5 days before the first event, so it was important to work asynchronously.

For the first 3 days, I was essentially coding up the designs in real time as they were being made. I wasn't afraid about having to undo my work because tailwind makes it really easy to build designs fast.

Here's an example of some of the early designs:

Just kidding, that's a lie. These weren't the early designs, these were the all of the finished designs that the designer left me with.

### navigating crunch time

With just 48 hours remaining, I was now tasked with..

- Completing the markup for the designs.
- Polishing the design myself so that it's professional enough to be shown on stream.
- Designing my own animations and layout transitions, and then implementing them.
- Rigging the graphics up to the dashboard so it can be controlled.

I also had to do all of this while making enough time to attend my sister's volleyball tournament!

Under these conditions, it was crucial prioritize what are 100% required tasks to be done, and what are the "nice-to-haves" left over.

#### priority 1: rigging

Rigging was top priority, no matter how unpolished the designs may be, if they can't be controlled, we don't have an event to show. So that was the first thing that I worked on implementing.

Although animations were not being worked on, I made sure to bookmark the components that would need to be animated later whenever I knew I would need it. That way I was able to save myself a couple of hours once it was time to actually put the animations in!

#### priority 2: polish

Once rigging was completed, and all of the bugs were ironed out, I knew next priority was polishing the designs, it made no sense to set up all of the layout transitions if the designs were to be restructured anyway! And to be honest, I couldn't let myself allow these graphics to remain untouched.

This step was the one that took much longer than expected, as I ran into a lot of design issues and it was difficult to try to keep as much faithful to the original vision, while ensuring that it was feasible.

One of the biggest challenges in this step was implementing all of the parts that were not part of the original design specification. For example the leaderboard, or how the maplist should show completed games.

#### priority 3: layout transitions

I think the design bit that I'm most proud of in this graphics bundle has to be the heading component!

It adapts to the content height by shifting up and down to ensure that the content below is evenly spaced, while the text inside the component fades to showcase whatever is relevant for the active page.

#### priority 4: animations + treats!

At this point, I probably had about 6 hours left before the tournament started, so I had to pick what animations were important enough to show, the ones that were most common to be noticed by the viewer. Everything else would be delegated to next week (this event ran over the course of 6 weeks).

The text fades on the heading component was among the first to implement, as well as the scoreboard and commentators panel on the game screen.

I ended up still working on all of the animations and stuff even as the event was going on, it must have been funny for spectators to watch the graphics get progressively better as the tournament went on.

One of those examples are the bouncy icons on the scoreboard! They were actually not part of the original design specification, I just thought it would be really cool while finishing up all the rest of the animations! I think I made the right call.
