# ideation

This major tournament was a collaboration between 2 tournament organizations, and I was tasked with working with a designer to codeify the graphics that they will give me.

Here's an example of some of the early designs:

![](/cg-fabl_3.webp)

Just kidding, that's a lie. These weren't the early designs, these were the final designs that the designer left me with.

## An increased workload with less time

You see, there were unforeseen external factors that meant the designer wasn't able to finish polishing the final designs, before the first week started.

> so I offered to take over and see the designs over the finish line!

However, we were working on a very short timeframe at this point, so the extra workload meant that **I would have to be very efficient if I wanted to finish graphics on time**.

To top it all off, I also had see my sister's volleyball tournament that weekend!

## 5 days before the deadline

The designer started working on the designs with about 5 days before the event started. Thus, it was important to work asynchronously to maximize time.

So while the designer was working on the designs live, **I was essentially writing the markup for the designs in real time**.
I wasn't afraid about having to undo my work because Tailwind makes it really easy to build designs fast.

## 48 hours before the deadline

This is the point that the designer had to halt, and I took over the remainder of the designs, so I was now tasked with...

- **Completing the markup** for the designs.
- **Polishing the designs** myself, so that it's professional enough to be shown on stream.
- **Designing my own animations and layout transitions**, and then implementing them.
- **Rigging the graphics** up to the dashboard so it can be controlled.
- _(Attending my sister's volleyball tournament!)_

Under these conditions, it was crucial prioritize what are 100% required tasks to be done, and what are the "nice-to-haves" left over.

# iteration

## engineering # priority 1: rigging

<Topic engineering>

Rigging was top priority, no matter what the designs look like, if they can't be controlled, we don't have an event to show. So that was the first thing that I worked on implementing.

Although animations were not being worked on, I made sure to bookmark the components that would need to be animated later whenever I knew I would need it. That way I was able to save myself a couple of hours once it was time to actually put the animations in!

The most complex thing to rig was the **live leaderboard scene, which pulls data directly from an API to display stats on each player** and their standing.

## design # priority 2: polish

<Topic design>

Once rigging was completed, and all of the bugs were ironed out, I knew next priority was polishing the designs, it made no sense to set up all of the layout transitions if the designs were to be restructured anyway! And to be honest, I just couldn't stop myself.

This step was the one that took much longer than expected, as I ran into a lot of design issues and it took a lot of time to **figure out the hierarchy of information**.

One of the biggest challenges in this step was implementing all of the parts that were not part of the original design specification, such as how **the maplist should show completed games**.

## priority 3: layout transitions

<Topic design>

I think the design bit that I'm most proud of in this graphics bundle has to be the heading component!

> The heading adapts to the content height by shifting up and down to ensure that the content below is evenly spaced

while the text inside the heading component fades to showcase whatever is relevant for the active page.

## design # priority 4: animations + treats!

<Topic design>

At this point, I probably had about 6 hours left before the tournament started, so I had to pick what animations were important enough to show, the ones that were most common to be noticed by the viewer. Everything else would be delegated to next week (this event ran over the course of 6 weeks).

The text fades on the heading component was among the first to implement, as well as the scoreboard and commentators panel on the game screen.

I ended up still working on all of the animations and stuff even as the event was going on, it must have been funny for spectators to watch the graphics get progressively better as the tournament went on.

One of those examples are the **bouncy icons on the scoreboard**! They were actually not part of the original design specification, I just thought it would be really cool while finishing up all the rest of the animations! I think I made the right call.

# impact

The event went over the course of 6 weeks, with a total streaming time of `17h 31m`, averaging about `40` viewers per stream.

Learning how to crunch and work with another designer to build broadcast graphics at a very fast pace was a valuable learning experience. If I were to do it again, I would have given myself a bit more time to build out the graphics.
