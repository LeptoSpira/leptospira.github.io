      <p>
        a friend wanted to have some interactive overlays for a splatoon 3
        gimmick tournament based on randomly selected modifiers! so i made a
        party wheel broadcast graphic that you can configure and spin!
      </p>
      <p>
        features include reading from a config.yaml file to set each of the
        segments, you can configure the name, description, and even weight!
      </p>
