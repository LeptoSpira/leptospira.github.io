      <p>
        i worked with a designer to code and rig a party wheel broadcast graphic
        that you can spin with an interactive dashhboard! it's configurable from
        a config.yaml file that lets you set each of the segments, including a
        name, description, and weight!
      </p>
      <p>i also had to learn the hell that is trig to make this</p>
