# ideation

I was approached by a very busy client who requsted a commissioned web application. They were struggling to keep track of scheduling social events and they wanted an easy self-hostable solution for it.

The self-hostability of the solution is what made this project interesting. It must be static enough to work in a JAMstack architecture, while still having the functionality to query for events and automatically add them to your calendar.

## design # initial design document

We first started with a rough draft of some of the ideas that we wanted to include in the app, as well as a low fidelity mockup of the UI. We knew early on that the app should be a mobile-first experience.

</Topic>

Here are the main points that we settled on:

- Search filters to select for only certain blocks of time.
- A date and block selector that are two-way linked.
- Calendar events should automatically be published to the client's calendar.
- A "Private" view that also shows which blocks of time have been booked already.
- Open-source and self-hosted, so anyone can set up their own custom instance for free!

## code # fancy css for the time selector

The most interesting thing that I build was this time selector! The feature includes some preview text that goes away as soon as you click inside the input, which also needed to account for whether the field has been touched or not.

Sounds like you need some extra React state right? Wrong! I was able to pull this off entirely with css after-elements, with a bit of help from the focus-within state selector!

Here's a demonstrative version of my css:

```scss
 {
  position: relative;
  background-color: var(--slate-700);

  &:after {
    position: absolute;
    inset: 0px;
    background-color: var(--slate-700);
    pointer-events: none;
    content: attr(data-content);

    &:focus-within {
      display: hidden;
    }
  }
}
```

Here's what it looks like when I change the background of the after element to a semi-transparent red:

## design # designing the modal event preview

Since the modal has a preview that shows the event details in a mock "event" block,
I thought that the preview should persist after the event has been booked, but change state from being a preview of an event, to a successfully booked event.

Even the icon changes!

# impact

The project went live about one month after the initial pitch, and rather successfully! here's what they had to say:

> <span class="text-xl lowercase italic">"its pretty good ngl"</span>
