## fancy css for the time selector

The most techncially cool thing that I made was the time selector, there's a preview text that goes away as soon as you click inside the input, all of this without needing to pull any React state!

I did this using css after-elements, and the focus state selector, all the magic happens through this single tailwind class: `focus-within:after:hidden`. Everything else is for positioning!

```
flex items-center flex-row-reverse text-slate-500 relative after:absolute focus-within:after:hidden after:inset-0 after:bg-slate-700 after:pointer-events-none after:my-2.5 after:ml-12 after:mr-3 after:content-[attr(data-content)]
```

Here's what it looks like when I put a transparent red background on the after element:

## designing the modal event preview

Since the modal has a preview that shows the event details in a mock "event" block,
I thought that the preview should persist after the event has been booked, but change state from being a preview of an event, to a successfully booked event.
