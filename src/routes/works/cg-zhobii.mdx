      <p>
        i had the amazing opportunity to help contribute to the unofficial game
        changers broadcast by upgrading some of the more dynamic components of
        their broadcast package!
      </p>
      <p>
        i did the design and code for the sidebar, map selection, rosters, and
        bracket scenes with keybindings set to toggle show/hide animations. i
        also built a fancy dashboard to manage all of the data!
