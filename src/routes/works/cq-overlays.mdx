      <p>
        in order to simplify and standardize all of the overlays that i build
        for splatoon events, i set up a github organization to host a
        standardized dashboard to control the overlays that can be shared across
        all graphics bundles.
      </p>
      <p>
        features include automatically tracked map winners, easy control of
        changing scores, team names, rosters, and stage lists.
      </p>
