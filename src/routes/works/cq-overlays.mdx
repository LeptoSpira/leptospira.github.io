      <>
        In order to simplify and standardize all of the overlays that I build
        for Splatoon events, I set up a github organization to host a
        standardized dashboard to control the overlays that can be shared across
        all graphics bundles.
        <br class="mb-[1.2rem]" />
        Features include automatically tracked map winners, easy control of
        changing scores, team names, rosters, and stage lists.
